# CS5644 Final Project
- The main modeling notebook is called Main Notebook.
- All supplemental notebooks that were used for data analysis are prefixed with "supplemental-"
- This repo is designed for data to be stored in the /data folder, but data is ignored by default by the .gitignore due to size concerns. To run the programs, you will need to have the data files downloaded locally into your repo.
- Note that if you are running a jupyter notebook locally and make changes to the src files, you will need to restart your kernel to pick up those changes.
